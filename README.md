# RustyDex - The Complete Pokedex Tool

This tool is currently a WIP. When at a functional state, it will serve to be a
(hopefully) complete tool for all manner of pokemon related tracking, analysis,
team building, nuzlocking, and other informational tasks.

## Planned Features

1. Complete Pokedex - The first and primary DexApp the tool will provide is,
   fittingly, a complete pokedex. This pokedex will preferably contain much of
   the information that can be found on PokemonDB, Serebii, Bulbapedia, pokeapi,
   and other sources, but in an easily searchable, offline manner.

   Aside from just information, the pokedex is planned to allow for easy
   searching, sorting, and filtering of all pokemon on a large variety of
   criteria. Whether you want all pokemon that learn a given move, are available
   in a given region or generation, have a particular type combination or
   weakness, have particular base stat ranges, or just want to know how many
   pokemon have "mon" in their name, the pokedex should be able to fulfill your
   searching needs.
2. Team Builder - As a complement to the first DexApp, RustyDex is also planned 
   to include a TeamBuilder. It'll use all the same capabilities as the Pokedex 
   DexApp for searching, but will also include some analytical capabilities to
   help you build your teams. Whether you want to know if your team leans more 
   physical/special, has gaps in its type coverage, particular weaknesses you
   may have overlooked, or has pokemon that may be in competing roles, the 
   builder will hopefully serve its purpose in making team building a little 
   easier both for competitive and casual players.
3. Living Dex Tracker - The application not only will store information about
   teams you build, but will also be capable of helping you track your living
   dex. 

This is not considered an exhaustive list of features, but it should represent
some of the capabilities I hope the application will have when finished. Nothing
will be perfect, of course, but feedback and contributions are welcome!
